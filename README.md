## ðŸš€ Payzer-v2-REST-API
Typical node js application which would aid Payzer in managing user data. To prevent DOS and DDOS attacks the application is rate limited (some routes are token level rate limited and some routes are both token level and server level rate limited) along with some other security measures(such as verifying user's payload). Feel free to go through the code. 

Contribution for documenting routes via README is appreciated.
